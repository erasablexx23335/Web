    <h2 class="header">India is a developing nation, but it still faces many social issues that affect its progress and quality of life. These issues impact millions of people and slow down the country’s development. Problems like poverty, gender inequality, and child labour continue to affect families and communities. Lack of education, unemployment, and corruption make these issues worse. Social discrimination such as casteism, dowry system, and inequality still exist in many areas. Environmental issues like pollution and waste management also threaten public health. Although the government has introduced many laws and welfare schemes, solving these challenges requires awareness, education, and active participation from every citizen. A united effort is needed to build a fair, safe, and equal society for all.</h2>
