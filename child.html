  <h2>
    Child labour in India is a serious social issue where children below the legal working age are forced to work in factories, shops, farms, construction sites, or as domestic helpers instead of attending school. Many children are pushed into labour due to poverty, lack of education, exploitation, and unemployment in families. Child labour affects children physically, mentally, and emotionally, leading to poor health, injuries, stress, and loss of childhood. According to reports, states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh have the highest number of child labour cases in India. Although the government has introduced laws such as the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, Right to Education Act, and awareness programs to stop this practice, child labour still exists in many areas. To end child labour, society must support education, raise awareness, enforce strict laws, and help families overcome poverty. Every child deserves a safe, happy childhood and the right to education.
