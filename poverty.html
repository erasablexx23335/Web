  <h2>Poverty in India is a major social issue where millions of people struggle to afford basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, education, and healthcare. Many families live below the poverty line because of unemployment, low wages, lack of education, high population, and unequal distribution of wealth. Poverty affects the overall growth of the country and leads to other problems like child labour, malnutrition, homelessness, and crime. According to reports, states like Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh have some of the highest poverty levels in India. The government has introduced several schemes such as PM Garib Kalyan Yojana, free education programs, and employment schemes to reduce poverty. Poverty can be reduced through better education, job opportunities, awareness, and support for underprivileged communities. A united effort from the government and society is needed to build a better future for all.</h2>
